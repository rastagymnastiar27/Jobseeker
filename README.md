# Jobseeker Website (Mini Project)
This is a mini project built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. The Jobseeker website provides essential features for job listings, including displaying jobs, editing existing job postings, and adding new job opportunities.

## **Technology**
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- JSON

## **Packages Used**
react-icons: For adding icons throughout the UI.
react-toastify: To display notifications and alerts.
react-router-dom: For client-side routing.
json-server: To create a mock REST API using a JSON file.

## **Features**
- View Jobs: Browse available job listings.
- Edit Jobs: Modify job details as needed.
- Add New Jobs: Easily create and add new job postings.
- Delete Jobs: Remove job postings from the list.

## **Data Source**
The website uses a JSON API to handle and manage job data. [JSON file](https://github.com/rastagymnastiar27/Jobseeker/blob/main/src/jobs.json)

## **To-Do Guide for Demo**
Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

1. **Open the project in your code editor** (e.g., VS Code).
2. **Open the terminal** and start the JSON server:
   
   ````bash
   npm run server
   
3. **Install the necessary packages:**
   
    ````bash
    npm install

4. **Run the project:**

    ````bash
    npm run dev

## **Note**
Since this is a mini project, it does not include authentication. This means that any user can read, add, edit, or delete jobs without the need for login credentials. The website is designed for simple interaction and testing purposes.

I will develop this project in the future with new features, stay tuned!
